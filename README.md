## Installation and Setup üöÄ

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.8+ installed on your machine.
2. PostgreSQL installed and running.
3. A virtual environment tool like `venv` or `virtualenv`.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Musaddiq123m/ClassMate.git
   cd ClassMate/code/ClassMate
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create and Configure `.env` File**:
   - Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory.
   - Add the following variables in the `.env` file, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:

   ```env
   # Security Settings
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   DEBUG=True  # Set to False in production
   ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1

   # Database Configuration
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>

   # ReCAPTCHA Keys 
   RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY=
   RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY=

   # Email Settings
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.your-email-provider.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@example.com
   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-email-password
   EMAIL_USE_TLS=True

   ```

   Notes:
   Replace `<user>`, `<password>`, `<host>`, `<port>`, and `<database>` in the `DATABASE_URL` with your actual database connection details.
   The `DATABASE_URL` format is `postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>`.
   Ensure the `.env` file is added to `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive data from being tracked in version control.


5. **Apply Migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create a Superuser**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

8. **Access the Application**:
